        <p id = 'desc'> Hello! I'm Anirudh! Thanks for visiting my website! I am a sophomore at Rice pursuing a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and the Rice Center for Engineering Leadership Certificate.
            My primary interests currently entail data science as I seek to pursue internships in machine learning and data science. However, I am open to other opportunities as well.
            I am extremely self-motivated and will strive to successfully complete any project I start. I also have strong problem solving skills and work well with any ambitious team.
