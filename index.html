        <p>
          I have 3 years of experience in management consulting at Oliver Wyman, with expertise in both strategy and operations across various industries. As a graduate from Rice University with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and the Rice Center for Engineering Leadership Certificate, I'm currently pursuing an MBA at Columbia Business School, focusing on Technology and Entrepreneurship.
        </p>
        <p>
          My key skillsets include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Product Management & Strategy:</strong> Experience in GenAI initiatives at Oliver Wyman, enhancing productivity across organizations. Capable of managing cross-functional teams, driving product strategy, addressing user needs, and streamlining development.</li>
          <li><strong>Data-Driven Decision Making:</strong> Leveraging data analytics for strategic business decisions, conducting market analyses, and identifying optimization opportunities.</li>
          <li><strong>Technical Expertise:</strong> Proficient in Python, SQL, Flutter/Dart, and Figma, bridging technical concepts and business applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Communication & Leadership:</strong> Skilled in relationship-building, driving collaborative efforts, and communicating with diverse stakeholders.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I'm extremely self-motivated, with strong problem-solving skills and a commitment to project completion. My passion lies in hardware and GenAI industries, but I'm open to opportunities across all fields.
